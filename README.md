# Chapter 8 - Working with Glances

If you were to look up the word *glance* in the OS X dictionary application, you would see that the  first definition (to “take a brief or hurried look”) is followed by an example usage: “Ginny glanced at her watch.” Glances and watches are inextricably linked; the size and position of a wristwatch makes it ideal to glance at for quick information. It seems fitting then that Apple has used the word as the name for this feature.


## Projects

This repository contains two projects:

1. *GlanceCommander* - this is the main example project that we use to create a glance as part of a brand new project.
2. *GlanceEpidemic* - this is a secondary example project that we use to illustrate the creation of a glance as part of an existing project.


## Corrections

If you find a mistake in the sample code, please feel free to raise it as an [Issue against this repository](https://github.com/bwa-book/chapter-08/issues).
